Sample of a Jetpack system working in multiplayer.

This project is an example of how to write a custom [CharacterMovementComponent](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Networking/CharacterMovementComponent/index.html) using pure C++
to implement a Jetpack system in UE4, with the constraint of being fully replicated over network.
